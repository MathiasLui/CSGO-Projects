The maps are loaded, if they have a radar file and a corresponding text file, and could be successfully converted from DDS. You can also type when you open the combobox, to quickly find a map."

This value is a weighted sum of the height of all four points and should be most accurate, if all points are coplanar. To see where NAV areas exist, activate them in the settings. They will be coloured from lowest to highest based on their average height. In the settings you can also give a threshold of which areas to show. When you hover over a point where you have multiple NAV areas layered on top of eachother, use the PageUp and PageDown keys to move up and down layers. In rare cases the map might have wrong X and Y coordinates and/or a wrong map scale factor written in the map's text file. In that case the NAV areas will be offset from the actual map. To temporarily fix that you can go into the settings and change the current map's coordinates' offsets and the map scale factor override, the original file will be left unchanged."

The middle of a spawn is bright, if it's a priority spawn, otherwise dark, hostages however are filled with a red colour. All of these can be hidden in the 'Settings' menu, 2v2 spawns can be hidden separately, while all other spawn types are treated as 'general'. With a left click you set the first (target or bomb, depending on the mode) point on the map, and with a right click you set the second (player) point. These are used to calculate damage over range.

If you're connecting/connected to a map while clicking 'Connect', it will automatically open the correct map, if possible. After this you can use the two buttons to set the current in-game position as one of the points. Since we're just using the console, without reading any memory, we will need sv_cheats for the latter to work, thus only working on servers where you have admin rights, for example offline with bots."
